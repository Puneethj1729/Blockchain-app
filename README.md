Cryptocurrency App using Blockchain

This Project includes developing of cryptocurrency using blockchain techniques using Node.js and React.The PubNub plugin helps for  broadcasting the transactions in the network and achieved to interact the transactions within the blockchain and have a self available ledger/wallet for each of the node in the Network.

To run the project in your system:<br/>
1. Clone the respository.<br/>
2. Through the command line open backend folder and run ```npm run dev``` to start the backend server.<br/>
3. Open client folder and run ```npm run dev```.<br/>
4. Now you can work on frontend and backend and can able to do transaction from your wallet to any recipient and the blocks of the blockchain also visible along with transaction pool.
5. To Work with multiple wallets we need  to run server on PEER port and run ```npm run dev-peer``` and it enables us to watch the chain synchronization in all the nodes so the peer network blockchain is succesfull.
6. Atlast so now the blockchain runs in HOME Port and PEER port and serves one of the main aspects of blockchain: Interaction and Synchronization of chain among all PEER Nodes in the network.
